# Blocks are synced when adding new node <nodeName> with <gcmode> gcmode to network <networkName>

* Send some transactions to create blocks in network <networkName> and capture the latest block height as "latestBlockHeight"
* Add new node with <gcmode> gcmode, named it <nodeName>, and join the network <networkName>
* Verify node <nodeName> has the same block height with "latestBlockHeight"
